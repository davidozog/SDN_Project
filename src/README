=========================
Simple L2 Learning switch
=========================

The only way I've found to run this is to put the program (simple_l2_learning.py) 
into the pox source tree, e.g., ~/pox/pox/cis610/, then run like this:

python ~/pox/pox.py log.level --DEBUG cis610.simple_l2_learning



==============================
Flow stats and the MMP Process
==============================

At the moment I have the controller receiving an "is alive" message from the 
MMP process whenever the controller gets new flow statistics.  It then sends
the same message back to the MMP.  This isn't that awesome, but you probably
see where I'm going with this...

To run it, put the flow_stats.py program in the pox source tree and do this:
  $ python ~/pox/pox.py log.level --DEBUG cis610.flow_stats


The controller then blocks until you start up the MMP process.  Like this:
  $ python MMP.py

You'll then see the MMP print the "is alive" message every five seconds or
so - the same frequency that the synthetic timer in the controller gathers
flow statistics.
